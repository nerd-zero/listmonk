// WithTenant runs fn inside a transaction with `app.current_tenant` set for
// that transaction's duration (via set_config's third "is_local" argument,
// Postgres's equivalent of `SET LOCAL`), so the override doesn't leak onto
// a subsequently reused connection once the transaction ends.
//
// This is safe under Go's own connection pooling: database/sql binds a
// transaction to a single physical connection for its entire lifetime and
// only returns that connection to the pool after Commit/Rollback. See
// TestWithTenant_ConcurrentIsolation for a concurrency spike proving this
// holds for this specific driver/pool combination.
//
// This does NOT hold if listmonk is ever deployed behind an external
// transaction-pooling proxy (e.g. PgBouncer in transaction-pooling mode)
// that can multiplex statements from one logical transaction across
// different physical connections - that combination is out of scope here
// and must be verified separately before relying on it.
//
// IMPORTANT, found live (v6.10.0): when a transaction's SET LOCAL on a
// custom GUC ends, Postgres does NOT revert the setting to "unset"/NULL -
// it reverts to that GUC's session-level value, and the first time ANY
// backend touches a never-before-referenced custom parameter name (via
// SET LOCAL, current_setting, anything), Postgres materializes it as a
// placeholder with a default of '' (empty string), not NULL. So after the
// very first WithTenant call on a given pooled connection,
// current_setting('app.current_tenant', true) returns '' - not NULL -
// for every later query on that same connection that runs outside
// WithTenant (e.g. queries/campaigns.sql's next-campaigns, or
// GetUserUnscoped). Confirmed directly via psql: a fresh session shows
// current_setting(...) IS NULL before any set_config call, and '' (NULL
// = false) immediately after one SET LOCAL transaction commits, on that
// same session. v6.10.0 rewrites the RLS policies to
// NULLIF(current_setting(...), '')::INTEGER so the empty-string case
// never reaches the ::INTEGER cast and is treated the same as unset,
// rather than trying to special-case this here.
//
// The RLS policies from phase 2 (v6.5.0) are permissive while
// `app.current_tenant` is unset (or, since v6.10.0, ''), so this helper
// is additive: existing Core methods that don't yet call it are
// unaffected. Threading tenantID through every Core method to actually
// call WithTenant is issue #40's job, not this one.
//
// opts is passed straight to BeginTxx (nil means BeginTxx's own default,
// same as calling it directly) - callers that need e.g. ReadOnly: true as
// a security control (see subscribers.go's arbitrary-query features) can
// still get it instead of losing that guarantee to this helper.

// stmtx rebinds a pool-level prepared statement (c.q.X) to run within tx,
// so it participates in WithTenant's transaction (and therefore its
// app.current_tenant setting) instead of picking a random connection from
// the pool the way calling the statement directly would.
//
// This must be used instead of tx.Stmtx(stmt) directly: cmd/init.go opens
// the pool with .Unsafe() (several models don't map every returned column,
// e.g. campaigns.go's own "Unsafe to ignore scanning fields not present in
// models.Campaigns" - and every table has an unmapped tenant_id column
// since phase 1 unless its model struct happens to declare one). BeginTxx
// correctly copies that Unsafe flag onto the resulting *sqlx.Tx, but
// sqlx.Tx.Stmtx does NOT copy it onto the *sqlx.Stmt it derives - found by
// hitting "missing destination name tenant_id" errors that only appeared
// on the tx-rebound path, not on the original pool-level statement or on
// tx.Select/tx.Get called directly. Confirmed via sqlx v1.4.0 source
// (Tx.Stmtx: `&Stmt{Stmt: tx.Stmt(s), Mapper: tx.Mapper}`, no unsafe field
// set) rather than assumed.
