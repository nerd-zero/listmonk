# Multi-tenancy: research and implementation plan

Status: **all 9 phases implemented. Phase 9 (Operator API) shipped
2026-07-08, closing out the design doc's original phased plan — see that
phase's Decisions log entry for what shipped, the BYPASSRLS design fork
resolved during implementation, and accepted v1 limitations (no
per-operator audit trail, non-atomic two-connection tenant creation).
Issues #40 and #41 (follow-up threading/subsystem work split out along
the way) are both fully complete too. `users.username`/`email` were also
fixed to per-tenant uniqueness (migration `v6.9.0`) after blocking real
onboarding of a second tenant — see Decisions log. What's left, if
anything, is incremental: tightening the still-permissive RLS fallback
policy once confidence is high enough (see Open Questions), and the
remaining known soft global-uniqueness gaps (`subscribers.email`,
`links.url`) that are still deliberately deferred pending their own
`ON CONFLICT` review — neither blocks real usage today.**

Earlier phase-by-phase summary retained below for detail: phases 1-3 and
6 implemented; phase 4 partially implemented
(auth/subdomain resolution shipped; `internal/core` tenantID-threading,
split into its own follow-up issue #40, is now fully complete —
`subscribers.go`, `subscriptions.go`, `campaigns.go`, `bounces.go`,
`lists.go`, `media.go`, `roles.go`, `templates.go`, `users.go`, and
`dashboard.go` are all threaded through `WithTenant`/RLS, including two
cross-cutting fixes found while closing it out: every `INSERT` across
the schema now sets `tenant_id` explicitly (previously relied on
`DEFAULT 1`, which a real non-superuser RLS role would have rejected for
any tenant but 1), and the three dashboard/subscriber-count materialized
views now carry a `tenant_id` dimension (migration `v6.7.0`) after a live
cross-tenant read leak was found in the global fallback row they used to
share — see Decisions log for both); phase 5 fully implemented (settings
DB/Core layer shipped, subsystem redesign — SMTP/media/OIDC/manager —
split into its own follow-up issue #41, now fully complete: SMTP,
media/S3, and OIDC per-tenant resolution all shipped); phase 8 (public
route audit) done — no cross-tenant leak found in public routes, but the
audit surfaced and fixed 3 severe bugs that completely blocked
onboarding any tenant past the first (a hardcoded role-ID bug, a
global-instead-of-per-tenant first-time-setup gate, and two pre-existing
single-tenant `UNIQUE` indexes on `roles`/`templates` — migration
`v6.8.0`; see Decisions log); phase 7 (frontend audit) done — both
checklist items confirmed already satisfied by the existing
hard-navigation login/logout flow, no code changes needed; phase 9 not
started**. This document captures research and a phased
implementation plan for adding multi-tenancy to listmonk. It is an internal
engineering design doc, not end-user documentation.

concrete code-level plan (migration SQL, Go signatures, file-by-file changes)
and [`multi-tenancy-erd.drawio`](./multi-tenancy-erd.drawio) for entity-relationship

or the VS Code Draw.io Integration extension).

## Goal

Run a single listmonk instance (one binary, one database) serving multiple fully
isolated organizations ("tenants"). Each tenant gets its own users, lists,
subscribers, campaigns, templates, media, and settings (SMTP, from-address,
branding, etc.) — nothing is shared between tenants except the running process
and database server itself.

## Prior art

listmonk does not have multi-tenancy today, and upstream (`knadh/listmonk`) has
consistently declined to build it in:

- [#2872 — Native Multi-tenancy Support (Multiple Domains/Workspaces)](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/issues/2872):
  the closest match to this plan — one instance serving multiple
  domains/brands with isolated SMTP config, from-addresses, archive pages, and
  subscriber data. **Closed as "not planned"** by maintainers, no rationale given.
- [#2765 — multi-tenancy / namespace feature](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/issues/2765):
  proposes a `namespace` column on relevant tables, per-user namespace
  assignment, and `WHERE namespace = xxx` filtering on every query — i.e. the
  same row-level approach this doc lands on. Open, unaddressed.
- [#2395 — Multi-Tenancy Permissions](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/issues/2395):
  narrower ask (a `lists:create` permission so non-admins can own their own
  lists). Closed as not planned.

**Implication:** this is a fork-only feature. It should be built and maintained
as a divergence from upstream, not something we can expect to upstream or stay
trivially rebasable against — every future `git merge` from `knadh/listmonk`
that touches `schema.sql`, `internal/core/*`, `internal/auth/*`, or
`internal/manager/*` will need conflict resolution against the tenant-scoping
changes.

## Architecture decision

- **Isolation model:** shared database, row-level isolation via a `tenant_id`
  column + PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS), rather than schema-per-tenant
  or database-per-tenant. Lowest operational overhead (one connection pool,
  one set of migrations, one backup job), and RLS pushes isolation enforcement
  into the database instead of relying on every hand-written query in
  `internal/core/*` remembering a `WHERE tenant_id = ...` clause.
- **Tenant scope:** tenants are fully isolated organizations — separate users,
  lists, subscribers, campaigns, templates, media, and **settings** (SMTP
  creds, from-address, branding). Nothing is shared across tenants.

### Why RLS over app-level filtering

- [AWS: Multi-tenant data isolation with PostgreSQL Row Level Security](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/multi-tenant-data-isolation-with-postgresql-row-level-security/)
- [AWS Prescriptive Guidance: Row-level security recommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/saas-multitenant-managed-postgresql/rls.html)

Key points from research:

- RLS filters rows inside Postgres itself — a missed `WHERE tenant_id = $1` in
  one of the ~40 hand-written queries in `queries/*.sql` can't leak data
  across tenants, because the policy is enforced even if the application query
  forgets it.
- The recommended pattern uses a **runtime session variable**, not a
  per-tenant Postgres role:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE subscribers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

  CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON subscribers
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::UUID);
  ```
  The app sets `app.current_tenant` once per request/transaction (via
  `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction, so it auto-resets when the transaction
  ends) instead of creating a Postgres role per tenant.
- **Critical gotchas identified in research:**
  - RLS does **not** apply to superusers or roles with `BYPASSRLS`. The
    listmonk DB role used by the app must not have `BYPASSRLS` or superuser,
    or every policy is silently ignored.
  - `SET LOCAL app.current_tenant = ...` session variables are
    **incompatible with transaction-level poolers like PgBouncer** in
    transaction-pooling mode in some configurations — needs explicit testing
    against however listmonk pools connections (`sqlx` + `lib/pq`/`pgx`
    pool) before relying on it in production.
  - `tenant_id` must be the **leading column** in composite indexes on
    every scoped table, or RLS predicate filtering silently kills index
    usage (cited as "two orders of magnitude slower" without it).

## Current architecture (as of this branch)

Mapped against `schema.sql`, `internal/core/`, `internal/auth/`,
`cmd/handlers.go`, `cmd/init.go`, and `internal/manager/`:

### Tables needing a `tenant_id` column

| Table | PK today | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `subscribers` | `id` SERIAL | unique `email` must become composite `(tenant_id, email)` |
| `lists` | `id` SERIAL | |
| `subscriber_lists` | `(subscriber_id, list_id)` | |
| `templates` | `id` SERIAL | unique `is_default` must become per-tenant |
| `campaigns` | `id` SERIAL | unique `archive_slug` must become composite |
| `campaign_lists` | `id` BIGSERIAL | |
| `campaign_views` | `id` BIGSERIAL | |
| `media` | `id` SERIAL | |
| `campaign_media` | (implicit) | |
| `links` | `id` SERIAL | |
| `link_clicks` | `id` BIGSERIAL | |
| `bounces` | `id` SERIAL | |
| `mat_dashboard_counts`, `mat_dashboard_charts`, `mat_list_subscriber_stats` | (matviews) | need a `tenant_id` grouping column and per-tenant (or filtered) refresh |
| `users` | `id` SERIAL | unique `username`/`email` must become composite; a super-admin concept that spans tenants needs explicit design (see Open questions) |

### Tables staying global

| Table | Notes |
|---|---|
| `roles` | scoped indirectly via `users.tenant_id`, but the row itself isn't tenant data today — needs `tenant_id` too since roles are per-org (`SuperAdminRoleID = 1` shortcut in `internal/auth/models.go` needs rethinking per tenant) |
| `sessions` | opaque `simplesessions` store; session payload already carries the resolved user, so tenant flows through the user, not the session row |
| **new:** `tenants` | new top-level table: `id`, `slug`/`domain`, `name`, `status`, plan/tier if needed |

### `settings` — decided: fully per-tenant, no split

`internal/core/settings.go` + `models/settings.go` currently model settings as
a single flat global key/value table (`settings.key TEXT UNIQUE`), pre-seeded
with ~50 keys (`app.*`, `smtp`, `bounce.*`, `privacy.*`, `security.*`,
`upload.*`, `appearance.*`).

**Decision:** every key becomes per-tenant, including `smtp`, `security.oidc`,
and `upload.s3.*` — each tenant configures its own SMTP server, OIDC identity
provider, and S3 bucket/credentials. There is no global/per-tenant split to
design: `settings` just gets a composite key `(tenant_id, key)` (already what
the phase 1 migration does) and `models.Settings` stays a single struct,
always loaded/saved scoped by `tenant_id` — no `TenantSettings` split type
needed. `Core.GetSettings`/`UpdateSettings` gain a `tenantID` parameter like
every other `Core` method (same pattern as phase 4's tenantID threading).

Two knock-on effects worth flagging for implementation:
- **OIDC callback URL becomes tenant-aware.** Per-tenant OIDC means the
  callback route (`/auth/oidc/callback` or similar) must resolve tenant from
  the request's subdomain *before* it can look up which IdP config to
  validate the auth-code exchange against — the callback handler needs the
  subdomain-resolution middleware (see below) to have already run.
- **S3 client construction becomes per-tenant.** `internal/media`'s S3 client
  is currently built once at startup from global settings. It needs to become
  lazily-constructed-per-tenant (or a per-tenant client cache keyed by
  `tenant_id`), mirroring the SMTP-pool-per-tenant change in phase 6.

### Request flow changes

- **Decided: tenant resolution is subdomain-based** —
  `<tenant-slug>.listmonk.example.com`. `cmd/init.go:initHTTPServer` has a
  global `srv.Use` that runs before auth on every request (currently just
  `c.Set("app", app)`) — this is the insertion point for a new tenant-
  resolution middleware: parse `c.Request().Host`, strip the port, extract
  the leftmost label, look up the tenant by `slug` (short-TTL in-memory cache,
  e.g. 30s, to avoid a DB round-trip per request), and `c.Set(TenantCtxKey,
  tenant)`. Unknown slug → 404. Tenant `status != active` → a generic
  "workspace unavailable" page (don't leak suspended-vs-disabled to the
  end user).
- `internal/auth/auth.go`: `Auth.Middleware` resolves a user from session or
  API token and does `c.Set(auth.UserHTTPCtxKey, user)`. After tenant
  resolution runs first (above), auth adds one check: the resolved user's
  `TenantID` must equal the middleware-resolved tenant's ID, or the request
  is rejected — defense in depth against a session/token issued on one
  tenant being replayed against another tenant's subdomain.
- **Session cookie scoping:** host-only cookies (no explicit `Domain`
  attribute), not `.listmonk.example.com`-wide. Since one user belongs to
  exactly one tenant, there's no login-once-use-everywhere requirement, and
  host-only cookies mean a stolen cookie can't even be replayed against a
  different subdomain — an extra isolation layer on top of the tenant-match
  check above.
- **DNS/TLS:** production needs a wildcard DNS record (`*.listmonk.example.com`)
  and a wildcard TLS cert (Let's Encrypt DNS-01 challenge — HTTP-01 doesn't
  support wildcards). For local dev, `*.localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.1`
  in modern browsers/OSes with no `/etc/hosts` edits — use e.g.
  `tenant-a.localhost:8080`.
- **Single-tenant/self-hosted fallback:** some self-hosters won't want
  subdomain routing for a single org. Add a config flag
  (`app.multi_tenancy_enabled`, default matching current behavior) that skips
  the tenant middleware entirely and pins every request to tenant id 1 (the
  default-tenant backfill from phase 1 already guarantees this works) — keeps
  a plain single-tenant upgrade painless.
- Every `internal/core/*` query needs a `tenantID` parameter threaded through,
  mirroring the existing `getAll bool, permittedIDs []int` pattern already
  used for list-permission scoping (e.g. `GetLists`, `QueryCampaigns`,
  `DeleteLists`) — this is the existing precedent to extend, not a new pattern
  to invent. With RLS in place this becomes a belt-and-suspenders check, not
  the sole enforcement mechanism.
- `internal/manager`: `Manager.scanCampaigns` → `Store.NextCampaigns` →
  `queries/campaigns.sql:next-campaigns` currently pulls due campaigns
  globally with no tenant filter. Needs either a tenant-aware query per
  worker cycle, or the worker pool needs to iterate tenants and set
  `app.current_tenant` per batch. Per-tenant rate limiting
  (`app.message_rate`/`app.concurrency`, currently global settings) also
  needs a design decision — global cap shared across tenants vs. per-tenant caps.

## Operator API (cross-tenant management)

**Decided:** cross-tenant actions (suspend/reactivate a tenant, billing hooks)
are exposed as a dedicated REST API, not the per-tenant admin UI — there is no
UI-level "operator" role.

- **Auth:** a static bearer token from config (`LISTMONK_operator__token` /
  `[operator] token=` in `config.toml`), checked by a dedicated Echo
  middleware on its own route group (e.g. `/api/operator/*`), entirely
  independent of the session/JWT auth used by tenant users. Rotated by
  changing config + restart — no DB-backed revocation in v1.
- **DB access:** operator routes run through a distinct Postgres role with
  `BYPASSRLS` — this must **not** be the same role the tenant-facing app pool
  uses (see the RLS gotcha above: `BYPASSRLS`/superuser silently disables every
  policy). This role becomes the second consumer of the "separate maintenance
  role" already flagged for migrations/backups in the phased plan below.
- **Endpoints (as implemented):**
  - `GET /api/operator/tenants` — list all tenants + status + basic counts
    (users, subscribers) for a support/billing dashboard.
  - `GET /api/operator/tenants/:id` — tenant detail.
  - `POST /api/operator/tenants` — provision a new tenant (slug, name, initial
    admin user, optional `organization_id` — see "Organizations" below).
    Returns a one-time setup link (`internal/tmptokens`, in-memory) the
    caller delivers to the new admin so they can set their own password —
    the operator never sets or sees it.
  - `POST /api/operator/tenants/:id/setup-link` — reissue a fresh setup
    link for an existing tenant admin. Needed because setup tokens are
    in-memory/process-lifetime: an app restart invalidates every pending
    link, and without this endpoint the only recovery was recreating the
    tenant from scratch (which fails outright since the slug is taken).
  - `PUT /api/operator/tenants/:id/smtp` — replace a tenant's SMTP settings
    with a single server entry. listmonk has zero mail-provider-specific
    logic here — the caller is responsible for actually creating the
    server/credentials with whatever provider it uses, this only writes
    them into the tenant's settings. (An earlier draft had listmonk itself
    auto-provision a Postmark server per tenant; moved out once it became
    clear that responsibility belongs in the separate orchestration service
    that already owns Postmark/Cloudflare/DNS provisioning — see
    `listnun/docs/plan.md` in the sibling repo. listmonk's Operator API
    stays provider-agnostic: generic tenant/organization CRUD and generic
    settings-setting, nothing provider-aware.)
  - `PUT /api/operator/tenants/:id/status` — suspend/reactivate/disable
    (`{"status":"suspended"}`); a suspended tenant's subdomain shows the
    "workspace unavailable" page (from tenant-resolution middleware above),
    and the manager/dispatcher scan (phase 6) skips it.
  - `DELETE /api/operator/tenants/:id` — permanently delete a tenant.
    Every tenant-scoped table references `tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`,
    so this cascades into deleting all of the tenant's data (subscribers,
    campaigns, users, settings, etc.) — irreversible. Refuses to delete
    tenant 1, the default tenant every pre-multi-tenancy install and fresh
    `schema.sql` seeds data against.
  - `POST /api/operator/organizations`, `GET /api/operator/organizations`,
    `GET /api/operator/organizations/:id`, `DELETE
    /api/operator/organizations/:id` — organization CRUD, see
    "Organizations" below.
- **Out of scope for this plan:** actual payment-provider integration
  (Stripe subscription state, invoicing). The operator API just provides the
  status/suspend lever a billing webhook handler would call into.

### Organizations

**Decided (2026-07-09):** a tenant ("listmonk") and a customer aren't
necessarily the same thing — one customer may want several tenants for
different purposes (e.g. separate brands or departments), each still fully
isolated by the existing per-tenant RLS/subdomain machinery. `organizations`
is a new, deliberately minimal table (`id`, `name`, timestamps) that exists
purely to group tenants for operator-side management — it is **not**
RLS-scoped and **not** resolved per-request the way a tenant is; nothing
outside the Operator API ever needs to know an organization exists.

- `organizations.name` is unique (migration `v6.13.0`) — `POST
  /api/operator/organizations` returns 409 on a duplicate name rather than
  silently creating a second, indistinguishable organization.
- `tenants.organization_id` is a nullable FK (`ON DELETE SET NULL`) — a
  tenant doesn't have to belong to one, and `DELETE
  /api/operator/organizations/:id` never cascades into deleting the tenants
  under it: they're just detached (`organization_id` set to `NULL`).
- `POST /api/operator/tenants` accepts an optional `organization_id`,
  validated against `GET /api/operator/organizations/:id` before creating
  the tenant so a bad ID fails fast with 400 rather than surfacing as an FK
  violation.
- `GET /api/operator/organizations/:id` returns the organization plus every
  tenant belonging to it (with the same per-tenant user/subscriber counts
  `GET /api/operator/tenants` exposes) in one call, since "show me this
  customer's tenants" is the primary reason to look an organization up.
- Migration `v6.12.0`.

## Phased implementation plan

1. **Schema foundation**
   - New `internal/migrations/vX.Y.Z.go` migration: create `tenants` table;
     add `tenant_id` (nullable initially) to every table listed above; backfill
     a single default tenant for existing installs so upgrades are non-breaking.
   - Update `schema.sql` for fresh installs.
2. **RLS policies**
   - Enable RLS on every tenant-scoped table; add `USING (tenant_id =
     current_setting('app.current_tenant')::INT)` policies.
   - Confirm the app's Postgres role has no `BYPASSRLS`/superuser grant.
   - Add composite indexes with `tenant_id` leading on every scoped table.
3. **Connection/session plumbing**
   - Verify how `sqlx`'s underlying driver and connection pool interact with
     `SET LOCAL` — spike a small test to confirm tenant context isn't leaked
     across reused pooled connections before writing any handler code.
   - Add a helper (e.g. `Core.WithTenant(ctx, tenantID)`) that wraps a
     transaction, issues `SET LOCAL app.current_tenant`, and runs the query.
4. **Auth & request flow**
   - Add `TenantID` to `auth.User`/session payload.
   - Insert the subdomain tenant-resolution middleware into the request path
     (see "Request flow changes" above), running before auth; auth then
     cross-checks the resolved user's `TenantID` matches.
   - Migrate `users`/`roles` uniqueness constraints to be tenant-composite.
5. **Settings (fully per-tenant)**
   - Migrate `settings` to `(tenant_id, key)` composite key (no split logic —
     every key, including `smtp`/`security.oidc`/`upload.s3.*`, is per-tenant);
     update `models.Settings` and `Core.GetSettings`/`UpdateSettings` to take
     `tenantID`. Note the OIDC-callback and S3-client knock-on effects above.
6. **Manager/dispatcher**
   - Make `NextCampaigns` and the worker scan loop tenant-aware; decide on
     per-tenant vs. global send-rate limiting; skip tenants with
     `status != active`.
7. **Frontend**
   - Tenant switcher (if a user can belong to only one tenant, this may be
     unnecessary); ensure no cross-tenant IDs leak through the Pinia store or
     orval-generated API client responses.
8. **Public-facing routes**
   - Subscription pages, unsubscribe links, campaign archive pages, and
     tracking pixels/link-click redirects are all public/unauthenticated.
     Since tenant is now resolved from the subdomain before any handler runs
     (not from the entity's own row), the audit is: confirm every lookup in
     these handlers filters by the subdomain-resolved `tenant_id`, and that a
     valid UUID from tenant A can't be used to fetch data while sitting on
     tenant B's subdomain.
9. **Operator API**
   - New route group + static-token middleware + `BYPASSRLS` operator DB role
     (see "Operator API" above); tenant list/detail/provision/suspend
     endpoints.

## Decisions log

- **Tenant resolution:** subdomain (`<slug>.listmonk.example.com`), resolved
  by middleware before auth. See "Request flow changes" above.
- **Cross-tenant management:** no UI-level super-admin. A separate Operator
  API (static bearer token, `BYPASSRLS` DB role) handles tenant
  provisioning/suspension/billing hooks. See "Operator API" above.
- **Settings:** no global/per-tenant split — every key, including
  `smtp`/`security.oidc`/`upload.s3.*`, is per-tenant. See "`settings` —
  decided" above.
- **Phase 1 implementation (2026-07-07):** shipped purely additive — every
  scoped/join table + `settings` gets `tenant_id INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
  REFERENCES tenants(id)`, no existing constraint touched. The original
  code-plan draft prematurely re-scoped uniqueness constraints
  (`subscribers.email`, `users.username`/`email`, etc.) in the same
  migration — that would have broken `ON CONFLICT` upserts in
  `queries/*.sql` ahead of the query-layer changes. Corrected; see
  `multi-tenancy-code-plan.md`'s Phase 1 section for the full explanation.
- **Phase 2 implementation (2026-07-07):** RLS enabled + forced on all 15
  tables, with a deliberately permissive policy (`... OR
  current_setting(...) IS NULL`) rather than the original draft's strict
  "unset context sees nothing" — the strict version would break every
  query the moment the migration runs on a correctly-permissioned
  deployment, since the app doesn't set `app.current_tenant` until phase 4.
  Also added `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` (owners are RLS-exempt by default,
  and most self-hosted installs use one Postgres role for everything).
  Verified with a throwaway non-superuser role since this dev DB's own role
  is a superuser and would bypass RLS regardless of the policy. **Tighten
  the permissive fallback once phase 4 lands** — tracked as a follow-up on
  issue #29, not a new phase. See `multi-tenancy-code-plan.md`'s Phase 2
  section for detail.
- **Phase 3 implementation (2026-07-07):** `Core.WithTenant` (a method, not
  the originally-drafted package-level function) plus a permanent
  concurrency test — this repo's first Go test, since `go test ./...` had
  zero test files before this. The test creates its own throwaway
  least-privileged Postgres role rather than using the app's configured
  role, for the same reason phase 2's manual verification needed one: both
  this dev DB's role and CI's default Postgres image role are superusers,
  which bypass RLS regardless of policy. See `multi-tenancy-code-plan.md`'s
  Phase 3 section for detail, including a `t.Cleanup`-ordering bug caught
  and fixed along the way.
- **Phase 4 implementation (2026-07-07) — scope split:** investigation
  found threading `tenantID` through `internal/core` (the other half of
  the originally-drafted phase 4) touches 107 exported methods and 150
  call sites, none of which take `context.Context` today or run through a
  transaction — too large to do safely alongside the auth/resolution work.
  Split into its own follow-up issue; this session shipped only subdomain
  tenant resolution, `TenantID` on `auth.User`, and the auth cross-check,
  gated behind a new `app.multi_tenancy_enabled` config flag (default
  `false`) so it's additive like phases 1-3. Also discovered and reused:
  the `Tenant` struct and shared context-key constant had to live in
  `models` rather than a new `internal/tenant`-only type, to avoid an
  import cycle (`internal/core` already imports `internal/auth`). Verified
  end-to-end (login on one tenant's subdomain, confirmed session rejected
  when replayed against a different tenant's subdomain) via a temporary
  second backend instance, not the live dev one. See
  `multi-tenancy-code-plan.md`'s Phase 4 section for full detail.
- **Issue #40 slice 1 (`subscribers.go`) implementation (2026-07-07):**
  first slice of the deferred `internal/core` tenantID-threading work.
  Found and fixed a critical, repo-wide sqlx footgun that will matter for
  every future slice: `sqlx.Tx.Stmtx()` silently drops the `.Unsafe()`
  flag the pool `*sqlx.DB` is opened with (needed since every table has an
  unmapped `tenant_id` column post-phase-1) — fixed via a `stmtx()` helper
  in `internal/core/tenant.go` that all future slices must use instead of
  calling `tx.Stmtx()` directly. Verified real cross-tenant isolation at
  the RLS/SQL level (via a non-superuser role, same technique as phase
  2/3) since this dev DB's superuser role can't demonstrate it end-to-end
  over HTTP — a pre-existing limitation, not a defect in this slice. See
  `multi-tenancy-code-plan.md`'s new "Issue #40" section for full detail.
- **Phase 5 implementation (2026-07-07) — scope split:** settings aren't
  read per-request — they're loaded once at process boot into a global
  config, and SMTP pools/media store/OIDC config/campaign manager are all
  built once as process-lifetime singletons from it (no live-reload
  mechanism exists today even for the current single-tenant flow — it's a
  full `syscall.Exec` process restart). Making those subsystems genuinely
  per-tenant is a redesign, not a parameter addition — split into issue
  #41. Shipped: the DB/`Core` layer (migration `v6.6.0`'s composite
  `(tenant_id, key)` key, `Core.GetSettings`/`UpdateSettings`/
  `UpdateSettingsByKey` now tenant-scoped), with those four subsystems
  left as global singletons pinned to tenant 1 (documented in code).
  Found and fixed a real bug while *running* the migration (not caught by
  reading code alone): the upgrade runner's own version-bookkeeping query
  in `cmd/install.go` depended on the constraint this migration removed —
  the same class of issue phase 1 deferred constraint changes to avoid,
  slipping through here because it lives in the migration framework
  itself, not `queries/*.sql`. See `multi-tenancy-code-plan.md`'s Phase 5
  section for full detail.
- **Phase 6 / issue #41 slice 1 (2026-07-07):** confirmed Phase 6
  (tenant-aware campaign scanning) is only meaningful once real per-tenant
  dispatch exists — chose to tackle #41 (the actual blocker) directly
  rather than do Phase 6's scan-side work in isolation. Shipped #41's
  first slice: per-tenant SMTP messenger resolution. `internal/manager`
  gained a `MessengerResolver` interface (falls back to the existing
  global messenger map for non-SMTP messengers like postback, so nothing
  else changes); the concrete implementation lives in `cmd/` and lazily
  builds + caches each tenant's SMTP messengers from their own settings,
  reusing (not reimplementing) the existing SMTP-config-parsing logic.
  Verified live by starting a real campaign and confirming the resolution
  path executes (visible as a second `initSMTPMessengers` log line at
  campaign-start, not just boot) before failing at the expected point — an
  actual SMTP connection attempt to this dev environment's fake mail host.
  Media/OIDC per-tenant resolution remain as further #41 work.

- **Phase 6 implementation (2026-07-08):** unblocked by #41 slice 1,
  implemented the same session. `Store.NextCampaigns` gained a leading
  `tenantID` param and a new `GetActiveTenantIDs` method;
  `scanCampaigns` iterates active tenants each tick, calling
  `NextCampaigns` once per tenant with only that tenant's in-flight
  campaign IDs. Traced through a real correctness risk *before* writing
  code: `next-campaigns` reuses its "current IDs" parameter to both
  exclude in-flight campaigns *and* increment their `sent` counts, so
  naively passing the same global in-flight list to every per-tenant call
  would double/triple/etc.-count sends — fixed by grouping in-flight
  campaigns by tenant in Go, not by changing the SQL's counting logic.
  Separately, **caught a real bug via live-testing, not code review**:
  `pq.Int64Array(nil)` serializes to SQL `NULL` rather than an empty
  array, and `NOT(id = ANY(NULL))` is `NULL` (falsy) under normal SQL
  three-valued logic — silently filtering out every campaign, no error
  anywhere. A `running` campaign sat unpicked-up for several tick cycles
  before this was caught by directly observing the symptom, then
  root-caused by comparing against the original single-tenant code's
  explicit non-nil-empty-slice construction (which its own comment had
  flagged the reason for). Verified live end-to-end (started a real
  campaign, confirmed pickup on the next tick, confirmed the SMTP
  resolver and eventual expected-failure send all fired correctly) both
  before and after the fix, to prove the bug and the fix were both real.

- **Cross-cutting INSERT/RLS gap found and fixed (2026-07-08):** while
  starting issue #40 slice 2 (`internal/core/campaigns.go`), found that
  Phase 2's RLS policy (`v6.5.0`) has no explicit `FOR`/`WITH CHECK`
  clause, so Postgres defaults an `ALL`-command policy's `WITH CHECK` to
  the same expression as `USING` — meaning **every `INSERT`** across the
  whole schema must supply a `tenant_id` value matching
  `current_setting('app.current_tenant')`, or a non-superuser DB role
  rejects the row. Checked every `queries/*.sql` file: **zero** `INSERT`
  statements set `tenant_id` explicitly (they all relied on the column's
  `DEFAULT 1` from Phase 1) — meaning every write for any tenant other
  than tenant 1 would have been rejected under real (non-superuser) RLS
  enforcement. Invisible until now because the dev DB role is a
  superuser (RLS-exempt entirely — same reason Phase 2/3 needed a
  throwaway non-superuser role to demonstrate isolation at all).
  User chose the broad fix (over scoping to just campaigns.go or
  deferring): swept every `INSERT` across `campaigns.sql`, `links.sql`,
  `subscribers.sql`, `bounces.sql`, `lists.sql`, `media.sql`, `roles.sql`,
  `templates.sql`, `users.sql`, adding an explicit `tenant_id` param to
  each. This required threading `ctx`/`tenantID` through essentially all
  of `internal/core` in the process — `campaigns.go`, `subscriptions.go`,
  `bounces.go`, `lists.go`, `media.go`, `roles.go`, `templates.go`,
  `users.go` — which amounts to completing the large majority of issue
  #40 (Core-threading) as a side effect, not just its originally-planned
  slice 2. Also fixed two call paths that bypass Core entirely and thus
  never ran through `WithTenant`: the bulk CSV importer
  (`internal/subimporter`, gained a `SessionOpt.TenantID` set by the
  HTTP handler from the resolved request tenant) and
  `cmd/manager_store.go`'s `CreateLink`/`GetAttachment`/
  `GetInlineAttachmentByFilename` (called from `internal/manager`'s
  campaign-send pipeline, now threaded via `models.Campaign.TenantID`
  down through `Manager.trackLink`/`attachMedia`/`applyInlineImages`).
  **Also found and fixed a related, adjacent bug in the same file**:
  `LoginUser`'s query had zero tenant filtering — since `username` is
  still a global `UNIQUE` constraint (Phase 1, deferred), a valid
  username/password for tenant A would also log in successfully on
  tenant B's subdomain if a same-named account existed there. Fixed by
  routing `LoginUser` through `WithTenant` like everything else, so RLS
  narrows the match to the resolved tenant. This is distinct from (and
  was previously masked by) `internal/auth.tenantMismatch`, which only
  guards *replaying* an existing session/token against the wrong tenant,
  not the login call itself.
  Two auth-adjacent lookups were deliberately kept **unscoped** (new
  `Core.GetUserUnscoped`/`GetAllUsersUnscoped`, with comments explaining
  why): the session/API-token lookup callback
  (`cmd/init.go`'s `auth.Callbacks.GetUser`) must find a user regardless
  of tenant so `tenantMismatch` can compare and reject with a distinct
  403 rather than RLS silently making it look like "not found"; and the
  API-token cache (`cmd/users.go`'s `cacheUsers`) must hold every
  tenant's API users since an incoming token's tenant is only known
  after the token itself is matched.
  Found one additional bug via live-testing that pure code review had
  missed: `CreateRole`/`CreateListRole` were written accepting
  `ctx`/`tenantID` params but forgot to actually pass `tenantID` as the
  new trailing SQL arg — caught immediately via a live `curl` against the
  dev server (`sql: expected 4 arguments, got 3`), not by `go build`
  (prepared-statement `.Exec`/`.Get` take variadic `any` args, so
  arg-count mismatches are runtime-only). This reinforced the
  session-wide pattern that live verification catches classes of bugs
  code review and `go build`/`go vet` cannot. Verified live end-to-end
  after the fix: created a list, subscriber (with list subscription),
  template, user role, list role (with list permissions), user, media
  upload, and a campaign (with list + media attachment), then ran the
  campaign to completion (draft → running → finished) confirming
  `campaign_media`, `campaign_lists`, and `links` (via a real
  `@TrackLink`-tagged URL, exercising the previously-Core-bypassing
  `CreateLink` path) all wrote rows with the correct `tenant_id` before
  the expected fake-SMTP-host send failure. All test data cleaned up
  afterward. No new migration needed — `tenant_id` columns already
  existed from Phase 1; this was purely a `queries/*.sql` +
  `internal/core`/`cmd` fix.

- **Matview cross-tenant data leak found and fixed, closing issue #40
  (2026-07-08):** picking up the one remaining #40 file
  (`internal/core/dashboard.go`) surfaced that this was more than a
  threading gap. `mat_dashboard_counts`, `mat_dashboard_charts`, and
  `mat_list_subscriber_stats` (this doc's own "Matview refresh cost"
  open question, until now) each computed a **single global row** with
  no `tenant_id` column at all. Worse than the write-rejection shape of
  the INSERT gap above: this was a **live cross-tenant read leak**.
  `queries/subscribers.sql`'s `query-subscribers-count-all` falls back to
  `mat_list_subscriber_stats`'s `list_id=0` "all subscribers" row
  whenever a request has no list filter — the common case (Subscribers
  page load, no search) — so every tenant's unfiltered subscriber total
  was silently the sum across every tenant's subscribers, not just their
  own. Same shape for the dashboard's subscriber/list/campaign totals and
  the click/view charts. Given the severity, asked the user whether to
  fix now, file an issue, or explain first — user chose **fix now**.
  Migration `v6.7.0` rewrites all three materialized views to compute
  one row per tenant (driven by a join/group against the `tenants`
  table), widens each view's required unique index to lead with
  `tenant_id` (needed for `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY`,
  already used by `Core.RefreshMatView`), and adds an explicit
  `tenant_id` filter to `get-dashboard-charts`/`get-dashboard-counts`/
  `query-subscribers-count-all`. The refresh mechanism itself is
  unchanged — one `REFRESH` statement still refreshes every tenant's row
  at once, matching this doc's own recommended default (keep the global
  refresh cadence, filter by `tenant_id` at query time) instead of
  building per-tenant incremental refresh. `dashboard.go`'s two methods
  now take `ctx`/`tenantID` like the rest of `internal/core`, closing out
  issue #40 completely.
  **Found a second instance of the exact same class of bug already fixed
  once this session**: `GetDashboardCharts`/`GetDashboardCounts` were
  written accepting `ctx`/`tenantID` and correctly opening a
  `WithTenant` transaction, but the actual `.Get(&out, ...)` call forgot
  to pass `tenantID` as the query's new `$1` arg — caught immediately via
  live `curl` (`sql: expected 1 arguments, got 0`), not by `go build`/`go
  vet`. Fixed and reverified live. Verified end-to-end against the dev
  DB: ran the migration, confirmed via `psql` that each matview now has
  one correctly-scoped row per tenant, then hit `/api/dashboard/counts`,
  `/api/dashboard/charts`, and `/api/subscribers` over HTTP and confirmed
  correct tenant-1-only numbers.

- **Issue #41 slice 2 — media/S3 per-tenant store resolution implemented
  (2026-07-08):** same shape as #41 slice 1 (SMTP): `upload.*` settings
  were already per-tenant (Phase 5), but the `media.Store` consumer was
  still a single process-lifetime singleton built once at boot. New
  `cmd/tenant_media.go`'s `tenantMedia` lazily builds and caches a
  `media.Store` per tenant from that tenant's own settings, reusing
  `initMediaStore` (refactored to return an error instead of calling
  `lo.Fatalf`, mirroring `initSMTPMessengers`'s Phase-41-slice-1 change,
  so a lazy per-tenant failure doesn't crash the whole process). Unlike
  the SMTP resolver, **no fallback map was needed** — every media
  consumer (`cmd/media.go`'s HTTP handlers, `cmd/manager_store.go`'s
  campaign-attachment methods on the real send path) already has a
  `tenantID` in scope, so `App.media`'s type changed outright from
  `media.Store` to `*tenantMedia`. Also fixed `cmd/admin.go`'s
  `GetServerConfig` (the frontend's config-bootstrap endpoint), which had
  the same latent bug as everywhere else pre-fix: it reported the global
  boot-time upload provider rather than the requesting tenant's actual
  one. Verified live: uploaded a file, confirmed `/api/config` reports
  the correct per-tenant provider, then ran a real campaign with that
  media attached to completion, confirming the campaign-send path's
  `GetAttachment` resolved correctly through the new per-tenant store
  before the expected fake-SMTP-host failure. Remaining in #41: only
  OIDC per-tenant config resolution.

- **Issue #41 slice 3 — OIDC per-tenant config resolution implemented,
  closes #41 (2026-07-08):** structurally different from the SMTP/media
  slices since `internal/auth` correctly never imports `internal/core` —
  extended the package's existing `Callbacks` bridge pattern
  (`GetCookie`/`SetCookie`/`GetUser`) with a new `GetOIDCConfig(tenantID)
  (OIDCConfig, error)` callback rather than introducing a `cmd/`-side
  resolver type. `Auth`'s single global `provider`/`verifier`/`oauthCfg`
  fields became a `map[int]*tenantOIDC` cache (reusing the struct's
  existing mutex). Unlike SMTP/media, there was no boot-time fail-fast to
  preserve — OIDC was already lazily initialized on first use even in the
  original single-tenant code, so no `initX(ko) (X, error)`-style refactor
  was needed. `RedirectURL` is computed in the callback (`cmd/init.go`)
  from that tenant's own `AppRootURL`, not a single global one, so the
  OAuth callback lands back on the correct subdomain per tenant.
  **A genuine design decision, not just mechanical threading**:
  `cmd/handlers.go` only registered `/auth/oidc` at boot if the global
  config had OIDC enabled — under true per-tenant OIDC, one tenant could
  enable it while the boot-time snapshot (tenant 1's settings) doesn't,
  or vice versa. Resolved by registering the routes when
  `app.multi_tenancy_enabled` is true (request-time per-tenant checks
  take over from there) **or** the existing global flag is true
  (unchanged behavior for today's default single-tenant deployments).
  Also fixed the same "global config leaking into a per-tenant response"
  bug class as slice 2's `GetServerConfig`, this time in
  `renderLoginPage` (which OIDC button to show) and `createOIDCUser`
  (which default role IDs to auto-provision with) — both now read the
  resolved tenant's `GetSettings` instead of `a.cfg.Security.OIDC.*`.
  **Verified live against a real IdP**, not a stub: enabled OIDC via the
  Settings API pointed at `https://accounts.google.com` with a fake
  client ID, confirmed the settings-restart flipped `/auth/oidc` from 404
  to registered, then confirmed a real `302` redirect to a genuine Google
  OAuth URL with the correct `client_id` and a `redirect_uri` derived
  from tenant 1's own root URL — proving `oidc.NewProvider`'s real network
  discovery succeeded and the whole resolver chain was live, not
  hypothetical. Restored OIDC to disabled and confirmed the route
  reverted to 404 afterward. Issue #41 is now fully complete.

- **Phase 8 — public-facing route audit implemented (2026-07-08): no
  cross-tenant leak in public routes, but 3 severe onboarding-blocking
  bugs found and fixed.** Audited every multi-UUID public route
  (`ViewCampaignMessage`, `LinkRedirect`, `RegisterCampaignView`,
  `SubscriptionPrefs`) against this doc's own audit criterion — does a
  second UUID/ID param get trusted without re-checking it belongs to the
  same resolved tenant as the first? Traced every underlying SQL
  statement rather than assuming: all of them run inside the same
  `WithTenant` transaction, so RLS scopes every table reference to the
  same `app.current_tenant` uniformly — a cross-tenant UUID inside a
  compound query resolves to zero rows for that sub-lookup, either
  degrading to a mis-attributed (not cross-tenant-leaked) record where
  the column is nullable, or hitting a pre-existing `NOT NULL`-triggered
  silent no-op where it isn't. **No cross-tenant data exposure found.**
  Live-testing the onboarding path itself, however (a real second tenant
  created via a throwaway DB row, tested via `curl -H "Host: ..."`
  overrides against `127.0.0.1:9000` — confirmed
  `internal/tenant.Middleware` reads `c.Request().Host` directly, so no
  `/etc/hosts` changes were needed), surfaced three real, severe bugs
  that blocked onboarding any tenant past the first entirely:
  1. `doFirstTimeSetup` hardcoded the new admin's `user_role_id` to the
     `SuperAdminRoleID` constant (1) instead of the ID of the role it had
     just created. Only ever worked for the very first tenant on an
     installation (whose first-ever `roles` row coincidentally gets
     id=1, since the sequence is shared across every tenant) — every
     subsequent tenant's new admin ended up with `user_role_id = NULL`
     (the RLS-scoped role lookup silently finds nothing for a role
     belonging to a different tenant), a login-successful but completely
     permission-less account. Fixed by capturing and using the actual
     created role's ID.
  2. `App.needsUserSetup` was a single process-wide boolean, computed
     once at boot from whether *any* tenant had *any* user and flipped
     `false` globally the first time *any* tenant completed setup — so
     every tenant after the first could never even reach the
     first-time-setup form via `/admin/login`. Fixed by removing the
     cached field and adding `Core.HasUsers(ctx, tenantID)` (a cheap
     `EXISTS` query), checked per-request, per-tenant.
  3. Two pre-existing single-tenant `UNIQUE` indexes — `roles(type,
     name)` and `templates(is_default) WHERE is_default = true` — had no
     `tenant_id` dimension and hard-blocked (not just weakened isolation
     for) legitimate usage: the *second* tenant to ever run setup
     hard-fails creating its "Super Admin" role (duplicate key), and no
     tenant but the first could ever set their own default template.
     Both predate phase 1's `tenant_id` columns and were deliberately
     left untouched by phase 1 (see that phase's decision to defer
     pre-existing constraints) — this is that deferred cleanup, scoped
     to the two that actively block usage. New migration `v6.8.0` widens
     both to `(tenant_id, ...)`. Two *other* known global-uniqueness
     gaps (`subscribers.email`, `links.url`, already flagged earlier
     this session) were deliberately left alone — they cause soft
     collisions on human-chosen values, not hard failures, and widening
     them changes `ON CONFLICT` semantics existing queries rely on.
  All three were surfaced to the user via `AskUserQuestion` given their
  severity before fixing — "fix now" chosen each time. Verified via a
  direct SQL/RLS simulation under a throwaway non-superuser role
  reproducing `doFirstTimeSetup`'s exact operations (confirmed the *old*
  code's failure reproduces exactly as diagnosed, then confirmed the
  fixed code succeeds with a correctly non-null `user_role_id`) — a full
  HTTP-level test wasn't possible since the dev DB connection is itself a
  superuser (RLS-exempt, the same limitation documented since phases
  2/3). The `v6.8.0` migration itself was verified directly against the
  dev DB via `psql`, and existing single-tenant login/template/role flows
  were confirmed still working normally afterward. All test artifacts
  (throwaway DB roles, temp tenant row, temporary `config.toml`
  overrides) cleaned up and reverted to baseline.

- **Phase 7 — frontend audit implemented (2026-07-08): both checklist
  items confirmed already satisfied, no code changes needed.** Verified
  by inspection rather than assumed: `frontend/src/App.vue`'s
  `doLogout()` does a hard `document.location.href` navigation (not a
  client-side route change), unconditionally destroying all in-memory
  Pinia state; confirmed no persistence plugin or `localStorage`/
  `sessionStorage` usage anywhere in the store that could survive it.
  Login is symmetric — server-rendered (`cmd/auth.go`'s `LoginPage`, a Go
  template) and completes via an HTTP redirect into a freshly-initialized
  SPA, so no prior session's state can carry over. Grepped the entire
  frontend for "tenant" — zero matches — confirming tenant scoping is
  fully server-side and transparent to the client, as designed.
  Additionally, under the subdomain-per-tenant model, two tenants' UIs
  are different browser origins by construction, so browser storage is
  origin-partitioned regardless — cross-*tenant* leakage isn't reachable
  even in principle without a deliberate architecture change. The
  original checklist concern (stale state surviving a user switch) was
  actually about same-tenant user hygiene, and that's already handled by
  the existing hard-navigation logout.

- **Phase 9 — Operator API implemented (2026-07-08), closing out the
  original phased plan.** Built close to this doc's sketch (new
  `internal/operator` package, static bearer-token middleware, a
  `/api/operator/*` route group entirely separate from the tenant-facing
  app), with two things resolved concretely during implementation rather
  than left as sketched:
  - **The `BYPASSRLS` DB role turned out to be a genuine design fork, not
    a given.** `tenants` itself carries no RLS policy at all (it's the
    table that *identifies* tenants), so the normal app role can already
    read/write it freely — the only thing that actually needs
    cross-tenant visibility is the tenant-listing view's aggregate
    `user_count`/`subscriber_count` columns (every tenant's counts
    visible at once, impossible under RLS scoped to one
    `current_setting('app.current_tenant')` at a time). Surfaced this as
    an explicit choice via `AskUserQuestion` — skip the whole
    second-connection/new-role setup and loop per-tenant via the existing
    `WithTenant` helper instead, vs. build the `BYPASSRLS` connection as
    originally planned. **User chose to build it as planned.** Creating
    the initial tenant admin deliberately does *not* use this elevated
    connection, though — it's a same-tenant write against the
    newly-allocated tenant's own ID, so it reuses the ordinary
    `Core.CreateRole`/`Core.CreateUser` (the same hardened methods
    `doFirstTimeSetup` uses, including this session's earlier role-ID-capture
    fix) via the normal tenant-app pool, confining the `BYPASSRLS`
    connection's blast radius to just the `tenants` table and its
    cross-tenant count aggregates.
  - **The "how does the initial admin get credentials" open question**
    was resolved using the doc's own suggested v1 placeholder: `CreateTenant`
    generates a one-time token (`internal/tmptokens`, the same
    in-memory store already backing password-reset/2FA — same accepted
    "a restart invalidates pending links" limitation), returns it (and a
    ready-to-use setup URL pointed at the new tenant's own subdomain) in
    the API response, and a new public `/admin/operator-setup` page lets
    the token holder set their password — no e-mail sending required
    (a brand-new tenant has no SMTP config of its own to send through
    yet).
  - **Found while wiring routes**: `internal/tenant.Middleware`'s global
    `srv.Use` registration was rejecting every `/api/operator/*` request
    outright, since an inherently cross-tenant path can never match a
    single subdomain. Added an explicit path-prefix exemption.
  - **Found via live-testing**: a duplicate tenant slug surfaced as a
    generic 500 rather than a clean error (fixed to a proper 409), and
    the setup-link URL's scheme was originally extracted via hand-rolled
    string slicing that would have panicked on a malformed/empty root
    URL (replaced with `net/url.Parse`).
  **Verified live end-to-end with a real non-superuser `BYPASSRLS` role**
  (confirmed via `pg_roles.rolbypassrls`, not another superuser): token
  auth (missing/wrong/correct), tenant listing with correct cross-tenant
  counts, tenant creation (the created role has every permission scoped
  to the *new* tenant, and the new user's `user_role_id` correctly
  points at it, not `NULL` and not tenant 1's role), the full
  setup-link flow end to end (including a real subsequent login with the
  password the new admin set), status transitions (`suspended` → 503
  workspace-unavailable on that tenant's subdomain, `active` → restored),
  and the duplicate-slug 409. Confirmed the feature is a true no-op when
  unconfigured (route absent by omission, not just unauthenticated;
  existing single-tenant login/config completely untouched). All test
  tenants, throwaway DB roles, and temporary `config.toml` overrides
  cleaned up and reverted to baseline afterward. `go build`, `go vet`,
  `go test ./... -race` all clean.
  **Known v1 limitations** (matching this doc's original framing, not
  new gaps): no per-operator identity or audit trail (one shared token
  authorizes every request); setup tokens don't survive a process
  restart; `CreateTenant`'s tenant-row insert and role/user creation
  aren't transactionally atomic across the two DB connections, so a
  failure between them can leave an orphaned tenant with no admin,
  recoverable by an operator noticing and retrying.

- **`users.username`/`email` widened to per-tenant uniqueness, migration
  `v6.9.0` (2026-07-08).** Found live, not in review: onboarding a real
  second tenant through the just-shipped Operator API setup flow, the new
  admin's natural choice of username ("admin") collided with tenant 1's
  existing user of the same name — `users.username`/`email` were still
  plain global `UNIQUE` constraints, already flagged as a known, deferred
  gap during Phase 8 (unlike `roles`/`templates`, this one didn't block
  onboarding outright, just collided on human-chosen values, so it was
  left for later). "Later" turned out to be immediately, since it blocks
  real usage the moment more than one tenant exists. Surfaced the
  tradeoff to the user (quick unblock via distinct usernames vs. fixing
  the constraint) — **user chose to fix it**. Before writing the
  migration, confirmed (by grep, not assumption) that neither constraint
  has any `ON CONFLICT` dependents in `queries/*.sql` nor any
  constraint-name-based error handling in Go — unlike `subscribers.email`
  and `links.url`, which do and still need their own dedicated review
  before any similar widening. `v6.9.0` drops both `UNIQUE` column
  constraints and replaces them with `UNIQUE (tenant_id, username)` /
  `UNIQUE (tenant_id, email)` indexes of the same name.
  **Also surfaced (and fixed) a real dev-environment gap while chasing
  this down**: the dev database's own connecting role (`listmonk-dev`)
  was a Postgres superuser, meaning RLS was silently inert for the whole
  session's dev testing — every prior "verified live" claim in this doc
  that needed genuine cross-tenant isolation had to reach for a
  throwaway non-superuser role specifically because of this (documented
  since phase 2). This is why the very first attempt at onboarding a
  second tenant showed the *first* tenant's user as if it existed
  everywhere (`HasUsers` returning true for a tenant with zero users).
  Fixed properly rather than worked around: created a real non-superuser,
  non-`BYPASSRLS` application role (`listmonk_app`) with correct table
  grants, and switched the dev `config.toml`'s `[db]` section to use it —
  matching what this doc has said all along any real deployment needs.
  **Verified**: reproduced the exact collision via a direct RLS-scoped
  insert simulation as the app's own new role (proving the bug), then
  confirmed the identical insert succeeds after the migration (proving
  the fix) — the same technique used throughout this session for
  anything requiring genuine RLS enforcement. `go build`, `go vet`,
  `go test ./... -race` all clean. Confirmed both real test tenants'
  first-time-setup pages render correctly and the pre-existing `default`
  tenant's login is unaffected.
- **Organizations added (2026-07-09):** see "Organizations" under the
  Operator API section above for the design. Migration `v6.12.0` adds
  `organizations` (`id`, `name`, timestamps — deliberately minimal, no
  status/slug/other fields since nothing needed them yet) and
  `tenants.organization_id` (nullable FK, `ON DELETE SET NULL`). Three
  new Operator API endpoints (`POST`/`GET /api/operator/organizations`,
  `GET /api/operator/organizations/:id`); `POST /api/operator/tenants`
  gained an optional `organization_id` field, validated against an
  existing organization before the tenant is created. **Also reverted in
  the same window**: an earlier draft of `PUT
  /api/operator/tenants/:id/smtp` had listmonk auto-provision a dedicated
  Postmark server per tenant directly (new `internal/postmark` package, an
  `[operator].postmark_account_token` config value) — reverted once it
  became clear that responsibility belongs in `listnun` (the sibling
  orchestration-service repo that already has `postmark_servers`/
  `provisioning_jobs` tables and, per its own `docs/plan.md`, is meant to
  call Postmark's Account API directly and separately call listmonk's
  Operator API). The endpoint that shipped instead is fully
  provider-agnostic: it writes whatever SMTP config it's handed into the
  tenant's settings, with zero Postmark-specific code in listmonk.
  **Verified**: created an organization via the API, created two tenants
  under it (`organization_id` correctly set on both, correctly `null` for
  a tenant created without one), confirmed `GET
  /api/operator/organizations/:id` returns both tenants with their
  per-tenant counts. `go build`, `go vet`, `go test ./...` all clean.

## Open questions

- **Matview refresh cost — resolved 2026-07-08:** `mat_dashboard_counts`,
  `mat_dashboard_charts`, and `mat_list_subscriber_stats` now carry a
  `tenant_id` dimension (migration `v6.7.0`), one row per tenant, and
  still refresh globally in one `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY`
  statement per `Core.RefreshMatViews` — the "recommended default" this
  entry originally proposed. What escalated this from a performance
  question to an actual fix: it turned out to be a **live cross-tenant
  data leak**, not just a future refresh-cost concern — see the Decisions
  log entry for what was actually leaking and how it was found. Move to
  per-tenant incremental refresh only if refresh time becomes a measured
  problem at scale.
- **Upgrade path for existing single-tenant installs:** the default-tenant
  backfill in step 1 needs to guarantee zero-downtime, reversible migration
  per this repo's [migration conventions](/CLAUDE.md) (idempotent, updates
  `schema.sql`, registered in `cmd/upgrade.go`'s `migList`). The
  `app.multi_tenancy_enabled` flag (see "Request flow changes") is the
  intended escape hatch for self-hosters who don't want subdomain routing.
- **Operator provisioning UX:** `POST /api/operator/tenants` creates a tenant
  + initial admin user — needs a decision on how that admin's initial
  password/invite is communicated (return a one-time setup link in the API
  response? require the operator to set it out of band?).
